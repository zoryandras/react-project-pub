Welcome!

This project is part of my portfolio. The created website is about renting dogs for lonely people (it's a fun project, nothing too serious).

I made the website with the help of React after 4 months of learing front-end development skills.

The page contains a landing page, a section with all the rentable doggos and a form, where you can add all the information about you. All the information is saved in a json file with the help of express.
